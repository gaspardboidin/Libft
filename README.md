# 📌 Libft – Custom C Standard Library


***📝 Description***

This project is part of the 42 School common core curriculum.

The goal is to recreate a subset of the C standard library while deepening understanding of memory management, pointers, and algorithm optimization.

Additionally, I am gradually integrating more advanced functions from other projects, such as:

*🖨️ Printf – Custom implementation of printf.*

*📜 Get_Next_Line – Function that reads a file line by line.*

(This repository will keep evolving with new functionalities over time.)

***🚀 Features***

✅ Reimplementation of essential C functions (strlen, strcpy, atoi, memset, etc.).

✅ Memory management functions (malloc, free, calloc, realloc).

✅ Linked list utilities (t_list structure, lstnew, lstadd, lstclear, etc.).

✅ Advanced functions from additional projects (printf, get_next_line).




***📂 Project Structure***

📌 libft.h → Header file containing function prototypes and type definitions.

📌 ft_*.c → Custom implementations of standard C functions.

📌 Makefile → Automates compilation of the library.

⚙️ Compilation & Usage

	make
*This generates a libft.a static library.*

***📌 Use Libft in another project***

Include the header file in your source files:

	#include "libft.h"
 
Compile with the library:

	gcc your_program.c -L. -lft -o your_program
 
***🎯 Skills Developed***

✔️ In-depth understanding of the C standard library.

✔️ Efficient memory allocation and management.

✔️ Data structures (linked lists, memory buffers).

✔️ Implementation of custom utility functions for larger projects.
